# Branding Guidelines
This document defines how to correctly use and represent the logo to maintain a consistent, recognizable, and professional brand identity.

## Logo Colors:
The brand identity relies on two core colors. Always use these exact hex codes:
- Primary Purple - `#AD04FF`
- Accent Pink - `#DE06FF`
> These are the only approved colors for the logo. Do not alter, replace, or use gradients outside of the official design system.

## Logo Usage Rules:
To preserve visual integrity, the following practices are strictly prohibited:

- Do not alter or modify the logo in any way.
- Do not rotate, angle, or rearrange elements.
- Do not squeeze, stretch, or distort proportions.
- Do not use outdated or unapproved versions of the logo.
- Do not apply drop shadows, bevels, or other stylistic effects.
> Rule of thumb: The logo should always appear exactly as designed. Any distortion weakens recognition and brand trust.


## Application Guidelines
For best presentation and brand impact:
- Animation is encouraged in digital environments (loading states, transitions, social posts). Keep animations subtle and purposeful.
- Always place the logo on clear, uncomplicated backgrounds to maintain contrast and legibility.
- Provide adequate clear space around the logo.
- Ensure the logo scales appropriately. It should remain sharp and recognizable at all sizes.

> The logo is more than a visual mark. It is the brand’s signature and symbol of trust. Treat it consistently, use it purposefully, and never dilute its impact through shortcuts or “creative” reinterpretations.

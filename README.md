# Branding Guidelines
This document defines how to correctly use and represent the logo to maintain a consistent, recognizable, and professional brand identity.

## Logo Colors:
The brand identity relies on two core colors. Always use these exact hex codes:
- Primary Purple - `#AD04FF`
- Accent Pink - `#DE06FF`
> These are the only approved colors for the logo. Do not alter, replace, or use gradients outside of the official design system.
